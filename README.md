# MMWave Radar AI Project

This repository contains the submission for the MMWave Radar AI Project.

## Project Structure

-   **Part 1: Synthetic Radar Signal Processing**
    -   `radar_simulation.ipynb`: Generates synthetic FMCW radar signals and visualizes Range-Doppler heatmaps for Empty, Metal, and Clutter scenarios.
-   **Part 2: Metal vs Non-Metal Classification**
    -   `classification_model.ipynb`: Generates a dataset of 300+ samples and trains a CNN to classify Metal vs Non-Metal.
    -   `radar_utils.py`: Shared utility functions for signal generation.
-   **Part 3: Hidden Object Detection Challenge**
    -   `hidden_object_detection.ipynb`: Implements background subtraction to detect hidden metal objects in clutter.
-   **Part 4: Deployment Logic**
    -   `deployment_design.pdf`: Design document for real-time deployment.
    -   `deployment_design.md`: Source markdown for the design document.
    -   `generate_pdf.py`: Script used to generate the PDF.
-   **Part 5: Demo Video**
    -   `demo_script.md`: Script and plan for the demo video.

## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib scipy torch scikit-learn seaborn
    ```
2.  **Run Notebooks**:
    -   Open and run `radar_simulation.ipynb` to see signal processing visualizations.
    -   Open and run `classification_model.ipynb` to train the model and see evaluation metrics.
    -   Open and run `hidden_object_detection.ipynb` to see the hidden object detection logic.

## Deliverables
